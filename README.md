# openAI API test
Make sure you have installed `poetry` and `conda` before attempting to run this project. <br>
#### Without the required .env file it won't be possible to make this work as expected.<br>
## Setting up our lab    
1) Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/PostboxRetinal/openAI`
2) Run `conda create -n openai python` and wait for it to finish
3) Run `cd openAI && poetry install`. This will take a while. It'll install all the required dependencies`(python-dotenv openai)`
4) From now on, if you want to fully run this project, you should ask us for the .env file or keep an eye on our presentation
